# Overview

This is a repository of Decision Modelling based on Excel that focuses on Linear / Non-Linear Optimization and Simulation. The models were designed to support a number of hypothetical - but practical and realistic - operational, budgetary, investment, and political decisions.

# High Level Description

### Linear, Non-Linear, and Integer Optimization
- A1: Plan budget and workforce for community park and police parking tickets to meet service demand
- A2: Design Transportation routes to minimize cost; pricing sensitivity analysis to understand investment opportunity
- A3: Plan workforce to minimize the gap in supply of FTE and demand of services of garbage collection; hospital staff planning to maximize weekly intake within budgetary constraints
- A4: Select new power plant sites to satisfy budgetary constraints and energy demand
- A5: Select Public-Private Partnership vendor to support city road maintenance requirements; Program funding voting to meet community and congressional requirements
- A6: Analyze various carbon trading policies to maximize CO2 reduction
- A7: Allocate advertising budget, police car asset, and teaching staff to maximize profit, services, and student performance respectively
- A8: Find the best amount of product to manufacture in order to maximize operation profit within resource constraints 

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- A9: Compare two investment strategies under different expected return conditions
- A10: Understand best- and worst-case operation scenarios to support workforce and budget planning; perform statistical analysis on confidence intervals and cumulative probabilities
- A11: Compare different purchasing options and weather conditions to support Homeless Shelter operation to save cost for the city

**Note:** the simulation is based on a free Excel plug-in called Yasai. It can be found here: http://www.yasai.rutgers.edu/
